## Test Implementation

We have implemented comprehensive tests for all components and services in the UniCal application using React Testing Library and Jest. The tests cover various scenarios and edge cases to ensure the application works as expected.

### Components Tested

1. **Header Component**:

   - Render tests for authenticated and unauthenticated states
   - Provider connection functionality
   - User menu rendering
   - Sign in/out functionality

2. **AIAssistant Component**:

   - Collapsed/expanded state management
   - Query submission and response handling
   - Error handling
   - Sample query selection
   - Loading state management
   - Input field validation

3. **CalendarView Component**:
   - Loading state rendering
   - Calendar event fetching and display
   - Error handling
   - Provider connection management
   - Integration with AIAssistant

### Services Tested

1. **calendar-service**:

   - Google Calendar event fetching
   - Microsoft Calendar event fetching
   - Event merging functionality
   - Error handling
   - Format conversion

2. **ai-service**:
   - AI query processing
   - Response handling
   - Error management
   - Event highlighting

## Test Setup

The test environment was configured with:

- Jest as the test runner
- React Testing Library for component testing
- Mock implementations for external dependencies like next-auth, headlessui, and Syncfusion components
- Custom mocks for localStorage and browser APIs

## Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run tests in watch mode
npm run test:watch

# Run tests with coverage report
npm run test:coverage
```

## Areas for Improvement

While we've achieved good coverage overall, there are some areas that could be improved:

1. **CalendarView Component**: Branch coverage is low (29.03%) due to the complexity of the component. Additional tests for various calendar views and event interactions would improve this.

2. **Header Component**: More tests for edge cases in provider connection and token management would be beneficial.

3. **Event Handling**: More comprehensive tests for event interactions, such as clicking on calendar events or handling drag-and-drop operations.
