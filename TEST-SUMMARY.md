## Test Implementation

We have implemented comprehensive tests for all components, services and API routes in the SmartCalendr application using React Testing Library and Jest. The tests cover various scenarios and edge cases to ensure the application works as expected.

## Components

### AIAssistant.test.tsx
- Renders in collapsed state initially
- Expands when open button is clicked
- Collapses when close button is clicked
- Shows sample queries when opened
- Fills input field when sample query is clicked
- Submit button is disabled when input is empty
- Submits query and displays AI response
- Handles AI service error gracefully
- Disables input during query processing
- Works correctly without onHighlightEvents prop

### CalendarView.test.tsx
- Renders loading state initially
- Renders calendar with events
- Handles events from both Google and Microsoft
- Shows error message on loading failure
- Updates when window listeners are triggered
- Allows changing the calendar view
- Shows event details in a tooltip on hover
- Creates new events when event is dropped on calendar
- Syncs event creation across services

### CreateMeetingForm.test.tsx
- Form validation checks for required fields
- Handles form submission
- Properly formats dates and times for submission
- Toggles services selection correctly
- Shows appropriate validation errors
- Closes the dialog when cancel is clicked
- Prevents submission when validation fails
- Updates form values when edit mode is enabled

### Header.test.tsx
- Renders correctly when user is signed in
- Shows appropriate buttons when user is signed out
- Opens account menu when button is clicked
- Shows Google sign in button when not connected
- Shows Microsoft sign in button when not connected
- Shows connected status when services are connected

## Services

### ai-service.test.ts
- Sends correct data to AI API and processes response
- Handles API errors gracefully
- Handles response without relatedEvents
- Handles invalid relatedEvents data
- Serializes date objects correctly

### calendar-service.test.ts
- Successfully calls Google Calendar API
- Successfully calls Microsoft Calendar API
- Handles errors from API calls
- Merges events from multiple sources
- Creates events on multiple services when requested
- Updates events on multiple services
- Deletes events from multiple services
- Converts events between different service formats

## API Routes

### app/api/ai/query/route.test.ts
- Returns 401 when user is not authenticated
- Returns 400 when query is missing
- Returns 400 when events are missing
- Calls Claude API when API key is available
- Falls back to rule-based processing when Claude API fails
- Uses rule-based processing when API key is not available
- Handles general API errors gracefully
- Identifies overlapping meetings correctly

## Utility Functions

### app/api/ai/query/utils.test.ts

#### findOverlappingMeetings
- Returns empty array when no events are provided
- Returns empty array when only one event is provided
- Correctly identifies non-overlapping events
- Correctly identifies events that start at the same time
- Correctly identifies events that partially overlap
- Correctly identifies multiple overlapping events
- Does not consider events on different days as overlapping
- Handles back-to-back meetings correctly

#### findFreeSlots
- Returns empty array when no events are provided
- Correctly identifies free time between meetings
- Correctly handles overlapping meetings when finding free time
- Shows no free time when meetings span the whole day
- Ignores past meetings when finding free time
- Only considers free slots longer than 30 minutes

#### extractKeywords
- Extracts meaningful keywords from a query
- Filters out common words
- Detects meeting types in queries
- Handles variations of keywords
- Returns empty array for queries with only common words

#### extractPersonName
- Extracts person name from "meeting with" query
- Extracts multi-word person names
- Returns null when no person is mentioned
- Handles different phrasings of "meeting with"

## Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run tests for a specific file or pattern
npm test -- --testPathPattern=AIAssistant

# Run tests with coverage report
npm test -- --coverage
```

## Areas for Improvement

While we've achieved good coverage overall, there are some areas that could be improved:

1. **CalendarView Component**: Branch coverage is low (29.03%) due to the complexity of the component. Additional tests for various calendar views and event interactions would improve this.

2. **Header Component**: More tests for edge cases in provider connection and token management would be beneficial.

3. **Route handlers**: More comprehensive tests for error scenarios and various query types in the API routes.

4. **End-to-end Testing**: Adding E2E tests to verify the complete flow from user input to AI response and calendar interaction would be valuable.
